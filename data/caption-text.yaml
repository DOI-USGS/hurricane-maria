  Hurricane Maria collided with Puerto Rico on September 20th, 2017 bringing with it
  an mix of high winds and extreme rainfall. Much of the island experienced flooding 
  and structural damage. 
  
  ### Details
  Watch as the map above animates Hurricane Mariaâ€™s path, cumulative precipitation, and its 
  impact on river gage height. Every six hours, the data are refreshed to show the 
  most up-to-date information. Hydrographs in the right panel show normalized gage 
  height at the 24 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gaging stations that are used by the 
  [National Weather Service](http://www.weather.gov/) to forecast flood conditions. 
  The U.S. Geological Survey's robust streamgaging network, which held strong against the pummeling of 
  [Hurricane Harvey](https://owi.usgs.gov/vizlab/hurricane-harvey/) 
  and [Hurricane Irma](https://owi.usgs.gov/vizlab/hurricane-irma/), was not immune to Maria's
  extreme conditions; see "x" markers appear when data were lost, conditions were beyond gage operating limits, 
  or instruments were damaged. Variation in the shape of the hydrographs is due to a number of factors that impact the effect of precipitation 
  on flow, including: stream size, storm-surge, reservoir operations, and other local 
  conditions. The USGS has many more permanent 
  [gaging stations](https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/) across the country; 
  less than 1% are represented in this visualization. The USGS also collects additional 
  information with [Short-Term Network gages](https://stn.wim.usgs.gov/FEV/#MariaSeptember2017). 
  More information about water science in Puerto Rico can be found at the [Caribbean 
  Water Science Center.](https://pr.water.usgs.gov/)
  
  ### Data Sources
  *Gage Height*: U.S. Geological Survey [National Water Information 
  System](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis). Time series 
  of gage height at sites with [National Weather Service](http://www.weather.gov/) flood stage 
  information are shown through time, ordered by longitude and normalized to site-specific 
  maximum gage height observed over the duration of the animation. 
  
  *Precipitation*: [National Weather Service River Forecasting Center multi-sensor 
  (radar and rain gauge) precipitation estimate](http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ridge2/RFC_Precip/) 
  shapefiles aggregated to a complete grid for the hurricane.
  
  *Storm Track*: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Hurricane Center 
  [Preliminary Best Track](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/) for Hurricane Irma.
