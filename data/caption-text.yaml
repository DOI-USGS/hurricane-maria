  Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, bringing with it a
  mix of high winds and extreme rainfall. Much of the island experienced flooding and
  structural damage along with a loss of electricity and water.
  
  ### Details
  Watch as the map above animates Hurricane Maria's path, the cumulative precipitation
  the storm dropped on the island, and the impact of rainfall on river gage height.
  New data are added every six hours. Hydrographs in the right panel show normalized
  gage height at the 24 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gaging stations that are used by
  the [National Weather Service](http://www.weather.gov) to forecast flood conditions. 

  The USGS's robust streamgaging network, which held strong against the pummeling of
  [Hurricane Harvey](https://owi.usgs.gov/vizlab/hurricane-harvey) and 
  [Hurricane Irma](https://owi.usgs.gov/vizlab/hurricane-irma/), was not immune
  to Maria's extreme conditions - see "x" markers appear when data were lost, conditions
  were beyond gage operating
  limits, or instruments were damaged. The hydrographs vary in shape due to differences
  in stream size, storm surge, reservoir operations, and other local conditions.

  The USGS has more than 8,200 permanent [gaging stations](https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov)
  across the country; 24 are represented in this visualization. The USGS collects
  additional information with [Short-Term Network](https://stn.wim.usgs.gov/FEV/#MariaSeptember2017)
  sensor deployments.
  
  When gages are damaged in a storm or when gages are needed in particularly vulnerable areas,
  the USGS can build robust structures to protect equipment and ensure data integrity. A
  recent example of where that practice was particularly important was along the coast of
  Texas. For example, the Brazos River near West Columbia, Texas was built up on a stand
  to help prevent the instruments from getting wet. Hurricane Harvey flooded the area with
  over 25 feet of water that remained for over five days but the instrument continued
  transmitting situational awareness data for the flood conditions.

  System](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis). Time series 
  of gage height at sites with [National Weather Service](http://www.weather.gov/) flood stage 
  information are shown through time, ordered by longitude and normalized to site-specific 
  maximum gage height observed over the duration of the animation. 
  
  *Precipitation*: [National Weather Service River Forecasting Center multi-sensor 
  (radar and rain gauge) precipitation estimate](http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ridge2/RFC_Precip/)
