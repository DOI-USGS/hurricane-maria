  The map above animates Hurricane Mariaâ€™s path, cumulative precipitation, and its 
  impact on river gage height. Every six hours, the data are refreshed to show the 
  most up-to-date information. Hydrographs in the right panel show normalized gage 
  height at U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gaging stations that are forecasted to or 
  have exceeded National Weather Service flood stage. Variation in the shape of the 
  hydrographs is due to a number of factors that impact the effect of precipitation 
  on flow, including: stream size, storm-surge, reservoir operations, and other local 
  conditions. The USGS has many more permanent 
  [gaging stations](https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/) across the country; 
  less than 1% are represented in this visualization. The USGS also collects additional 
  information with [Short-Term Network gages](http://stn.wim.usgs.gov/FEV/#IrmaSep2017).  
  
  ### Data Sources
  *Gage Height*: U.S. Geological Survey [National Water Information 
  System](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis). Time series 
  of gage height at selected sites impacted by the storm are shown through time, ordered 
  by latitude and normalized to site-specific maximum gage height observed over the 
  duration of the hurricane.  
  
  *Precipitation*: [National Weather Service River Forecasting Center multi-sensor 
  (radar and rain gauge) precipitation estimate](http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ridge2/RFC_Precip/) 
  shapefiles aggregated to a complete grid for the hurricane.
  
  *Storm Track*: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Hurricane Center 
  [Preliminary Best Track](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/) for Hurricane Irma.
